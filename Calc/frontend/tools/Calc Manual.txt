I will run all conditionals to ensure the user's input does not violate my rules.
my app is simply divided into the following:
The first engine takes in user data and ensures the data is valid before adding or storing it.
The second engine takes the compiled data and renders it to the user according to its program.
The third engine takes the data from the first engine and processes it to produce the result when the user activates it.
